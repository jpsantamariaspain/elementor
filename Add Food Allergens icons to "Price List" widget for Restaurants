"Price List" widget is a very handfull tool for Restaurants or Bar webs but the big problem is that there is no possibility to add the food allergen/intolerance icons (lactose,gluten,soja,sesame,nuts...etc) wich in Spain and Europe is mandatory by law. It would be very helpfull if you could solve this problem and add this option to the widget Please.
